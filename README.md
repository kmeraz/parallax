## Getting Started

    - Note: This repo was developed using the latest version: v21.6
2) Clone this repo locally:
    - ```git clone https://github.com/kmeraz/parallax```
3) CD into the root of this repo
4) Install the required packages using NPM
    - ```npm install```
    - Note: NPM should have been installed along with the Node installation
        - It should be available as a global package in your local terminal
            - ```npm -v``` -> `10.3.0`
5) Provide your own API key in `/src/app/api/index.ts`
6) Finally, run the local NextJS server
    - ```npm run dev```
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Future Improvements
These are a few notes on subsequent improvements that could be made towards having a more mature product:
    
    - Invalidate quote after 5 minutes
    - Authentication (including logout functionality)
